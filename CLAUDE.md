This repo stores my dotfiles / most of the config that I need to setup a new computer.

## Configuration Files
Configuration files are stored with a suffix that tells the `install` script where it should be symlinked. e.g.:
- `<file>.symdot` => `~/.<file>`
- `<file>.symconfig` => `~/.config/<file>`

Files may be in any subdirectory of the repo; this is used to organize config files.
