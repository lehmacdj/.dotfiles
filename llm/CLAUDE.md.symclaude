- Always use virtual environments (or uv) when using python dependencies that aren't included as part of the standard library.
- Store temporary files that we won't eventually want to commit to the project in a subdirectory `tmp~` of the project root. This directory is ignored by default.
- Use `jj` instead of `git`
