## General
- Before creating new documentation, check if it is better to update existing documentation
- Store temporary files that we won't eventually want to commit to the project in a subdirectory `tmp~` of the project root. This directory is ignored by default.
- Prefer 2 space indentation unless otherwise specified; match existing indentation if it is not 2 spaces
- Try to keep lines to 80 characters or fewer, it's okay for the occasional line to exceed this limit if it improves readability

## Tools
- Prefer using `jj` over `git`

## Shell Scripting
- Use `set -euo pipefail` in scripts
- Prefer using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as the shebang for bash scripts
- Prefer writing scripts that are compatible with both bash and zsh

## Python
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Prefer using `uv` as the script interpreter if a python script has dependencies not included in python's distribution
- Always use `uv` or virtual environments for python dependencies not included in python's distribution
